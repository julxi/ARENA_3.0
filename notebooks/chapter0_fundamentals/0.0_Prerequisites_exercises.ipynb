If you're comfortable using them, then you can say goodbye to awkward NumPy/PyTorch methods like transpose, permute and squeeze!

    "Type-checking Python functions that you write is a great way to catch bugs, and keep your code clear and readable.

It integrates very nicely with Plotly (see above), can be hosted on your personal GitHub, and is very intuitive & easy to learn relative to other libraries with similar features (e.g. Dash). This is not compulsory, but if you like the look of Streamlit then you might want to think about using it as a way to submit (or even make public) your end-of-week or capstone projects. See [this page](https://copy-suppression.streamlit.app/) I (Callum) made for presenting the results from the Copy Suppression paper I worked on during SERI MATS, as an example of what Streamlit can do."

    "Although VSCode does provide an extension which acts just like a Jupyter Notebook, it actually has a much more useful feature. Python files can also be made to act like notebooks, by adding the line #%% which act as cell dividers. In this way, you can separate chunks of code and run them individually (and see their output in a new window). See [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) for a further explanation.  \n",

You can set breakpoints in your code, and closely examine the local variables which are stored at that point in the program.

Several of the advantages listed in the previous section also apply to .ipynb files created and edited in VSCode; the main reason we're not encouraging this for the ARENA in-person program is because we want participants to be able to write code that they can import from previous days (and because using .py files can help encourage better coding practices, rather than just creating a huge number of cells and dropping them under different headings, losing track of what code is where!).\n",

For anyone following this material virtually, we unfortunately won't be able to provide compute, so (assuming you don't have any way of accessing better compute yourselves e.g. via Lambda Labs) Colab might be the best option for you."

    "\n",
    "Before we go through the next exercises, we'll need to address one important topic in tensor operations - **broadcasting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both NumPy and PyTorch have the same rules for broadcasting. When two tensors are involved in an elementwise operation, NumPy/PyTorch tries to broadcast them (i.e. copying them along dimensions) so that they both have the same shape. The rules of broadcasting are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can prepend dummy dimensions (of size 1) to the start of a tensor until both have the same number of dimensions\n",
    "2. After this point, if some dimension has size 1 in one of the tensors, it can be repeated until it matches the size of the corresponding dimension in the other tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a simple example - suppose we have a 2D batch of data, of shape `data.shape = (N, k)` (i.e. we have `N` separate datapoints, each being a vector of length `k`). Suppose we want to add a vector `vec` of length `k` to each datapoint. This is a valid operation, because when we try and add these two objects together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `vec` gets prepended with a dummy dimension so it has shape `(1, k)` and both are 2D\n",
    "2. `vec` gets repeated along the first dimension so it has shape `(N, k)`, matching the shape of `data`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, our output has shape `(N, k)`, and elements `output[i, j] = data[i, j] + vec[j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting can be a very easy place to make mistakes, because it's easy to lose track of the exact shape of your tensors involved. As a warm-up exercise, below are some examples of broadcasting. Can you figure out which are valid, and which will raise errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = t.ones((3, 1, 5))\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is valid, because the 0th dimension of `y` and the 1st dimension of `x` can both be copied so that `x` and `y` have the same shape: `(3, 4, 5)`. The resulting array `z` will also have shape `(3, 4, 5)`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Although this won't raise an error, it's very possible that this isn't what the person adding these two arrays intended. A common source of mistakes is when you add 2 tensors thinking they're the same shape, but one actually has a dummy dimension you forgot about. Sadly this is something you'll just have to be vigilant for (e.g. adding assert statements where necessary, or making sure you aren't combining too many different tensor operations in a single line), because PyTorch doesn't have built-in ways of statically checking your tensor shapes.\n",

    "## Einsum\n",
    "\n",
    "Einsum is a very useful function for performing linear operations, which you'll probably be using a lot during this programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note - we'll be using the `einops.einsum` version of the function, which works differently to the more conventional `torch.einsum`:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * `einops.einsum` has the arrays as the first arguments, and uses spaces to separate dimensions in the string.\n",
    "> * `torch.einsum` has the string as its first argument, and doesn't use spaces to separate dimensions (each dim is represented by a single character).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For instance, `torch.einsum(\"ij,i->j\", A, b)` is equivalent to `einops.einsum(A, b, \"i j, i -> j\")`. (Note, einops doesn't care whether there are spaces either side of `,` and `->`, so you don't need to match this syntax exactly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many different kinds of operations you can perform, they are all derived from three key rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Repeating letters in different inputs means those values will be multiplied, and those products will be in the output. \n",
    "    * For example, `M = einops.einsum(A, B, \"i j, i j -> i j\")` just corresponds to the elementwise product `M = A * B` (because $M_{ij} = A_{ij} B_{ij}$).\n",
    "2. Omitting a letter means that the axis will be summed over.\n",
    "    * For example, if `x` is a 2D array with shape `(I, J)`, then `einops.einsum(x, \"i j -> i\")` will be a 1D array of length `I` containing the row sums of `x` (we're summing along the `j`-index, i.e. across rows).\n",
    "3. We can return the unsummed axes in any order.\n",
    "    * For example, `einops.einsum(x, \"i j k -> k j i\")` does the same thing as `einops.rearrange(x, \"i j k -> k j i\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note - the einops creators supposedly have plans to support shape rearrangement, e.g. with operations like `einops.einsum(x, y, \"i j, j k l -> i (k l)\")` (i.e. combining the features of rearrange and einsum), so we can all look forward to that day!*"
