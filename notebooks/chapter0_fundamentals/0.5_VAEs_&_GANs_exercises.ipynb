    "Today, we're studying two important classes of generative image models: **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**. Although these generally aren't SOTA any more (thanks in part to the rise of diffusion models), there are some deep conceptual insights which can be gleaned from studying these models (VAEs in particular) which help lay the groundwork for more advanced models.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises will also hopefully bring much of this chapter full-circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll cover transposed convolutions, which will serve as a refresher on some of the ideas behind convolutions **(day 2: CNNs & ResNets)**\n",
    "* We'll be assembling NNet architectures from scratch, like in the ResNets exercises **(day 2: CNNs & ResNets)**\n",
    "* We'll work with different loss functions, and think intuitively about what it means to optimize them **(day 3: Optimization & Hyperparameters)**\n",
    "* We'll be working with `wandb`, and will learn how to log outputs produced by our models **(day 3: Optimization & Hyperparameters)**\n",
    "* We'll have to think carefully about how gradient propagation works between different parts of our model **(day 4: Backpropagation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, many of today's exercises (especially those involving building models & writing forward pass functions) don't have as rigorous unit tests as previous days of content. Part of this is because the design spec for these models is less strict (we're not copying over weights from a pretrained model like last time, all that matters is that our model actually trains correctly, and so small changes to the solution architecture can sometimes be allowed). However, another part is that we're trying to move participants away from being too reliant on unit tests, and towards being able to independently reason through exercises or replications given just a description of the task or a paper implementation to follow. This is an invaluable skill to develop for any aspiring ML practitioner!\n",

    "## Content & Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Autoencoders & VAEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are a relatively simple architecture, at least compared to GANs: you learn a compressed representation of your data (mainly using linear layers and convolutions), then reconstruct it back into an image (with linear layers and transposed convolutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although autoencoders can learn some interesting low-dimensional representations, they are less good for generating images because their latent spaces aren't generally meaningful. This leads to VAEs, which solve this problem by having their encoders map to a distribution over latent vectors, rather than a single latent vector. This incentivises the latent space to be more meaningful, and we can more easily generate images from sample vectors in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with some reading material on autoencoders and transposed convolutions (which are often used in parallel with convolutions, to take a latent space and map it back into a full-size image). Then, we actually implement and train VAEs to generate MNIST images, as well as a do a bit of exploring our our autoencoders' latent spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Learn about the transposed convolution operation\n",
    "> - Understand the basic architecture of autoencoders and VAEs\n",
    "> - Learn about the reparameterization trick for VAEs\n",
    "> - Implement your own autoencoder\n",
    "> - Implement your own VAE, and use it to generate realistic MNIST images\n",
    "> - (optional) Dive deeper into the mathematical underpinnings of VAEs, and learn about the ELBO loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to autoencoders, GANs have a few more moving pieces in their architecture. They're best thought of as two separate networks (the generator and the discriminator) which are learning different goals simultaneously. The goal of the generator is to create images which fool the discriminator, and the goal of the discriminator is to distinguish between real and fake images. The ideal equilibrium point of training is when the generator produces perfect images and the discriminator can't tell the difference between real and fake - however, that's much simpler said than done! GANs are notoriously difficult to train, and we'll have to engage with some of these difficulties during our exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of these exercises, you should have built and trained your own GANs, to generate celebrity pictures. By the time you're done, you'll hopefully have produced output like this (below), and you'll have everything you need to set up a competitor to Midjourney (plus or minus a few other foundational ML papers and an investment of a few hundred million dollars).\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/gan-last-output.png\" width=\"1100\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Understand the loss function used in GANs, and why it can be expected to result in the generator producing realistic outputs.\n",
    "> - Implement the DCGAN architecture from the paper, with relatively minimal guidance.\n",
    "> - Learn how to identify and fix bugs in your GAN architecture, to improve convergence properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Bonus - Transposed Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll implement the transposed convolution operation manually. This is similar to a regular convolution, but designed for upsampling rather than downsampling (i.e. producing an image from a latent vector rather producing output from an image). These are very important in many generative algorithms. Once you implement this, you'll be able to build your own GANs and VAEs from scratch, without using any pre-built layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note - the bonus section from the CNNs day is a prerequisite for these bonus exercises. If you haven't completed that section, you'll need to do so before attempting these.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Learn about & implement the transposed convolution operation.\n",
    "> - Implement GANs and/or VAEs entirely from scratch."

    "\n",
    "**What are transposed convolutions, and why should we care about them?** One high-level intuition goes something like this: most of the generator's architecture is basically the discriminator architecture in reverse. We need something that performs the reverse of a convolution - not literally the inverse operation, but something reverse in spirit, which uses a kernel of weights to project up to some array of larger size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importantly, a transposed convolution isn't literally the inverse of a convolution**. A lot of confusion can come from misunderstanding this!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can describe the difference between convolutions and transposed convolutions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In convolutions, you slide the kernel around inside the input. At each position of the kernel, you take a sumproduct between the kernel and that section of the input to calculate a single element in the output.\n",
    "* In transposed convolutions, you slide the kernel around what will eventually be your output, and at each position you add some multiple of the kernel to your output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an illustration of both for comparison, in the 1D case (where $*$ stands for the 1D convolution operator, and $*^T$ stands for the transposed convolution operator). Note the difference in size between the output in both cases. With standard convolutions, our output is smaller than our input, because we're having to fit the kernel inside the input in order to produce the output. But in our transposed convolutions, the output is actually larger than the input, because we're fitting the kernel inside the output.\n",

    "We won't actually have you implement the transposed convolution operation in these exercises; instead we've pushed it to the bonus section. For now, you can just use the `ConvTranspose2d` module which has already been imported for you from today's solutions file, in place of your own implementation. You can use it exactly the same way you use normal convolutional layers: for instance `ConvTranspose2d(32, 16, 4, stride=2, padding=1)` will define a convolution layer that maps a tensor from `(batch_size, in_channels=32, height, width)` up to shape `(batch_size, out_channels=16, height * 2, width * 2)`.\n",

    "You should now implement your training loop below. We've filled in some methods for you (and have given you a dataclass to hold arguments), your job is to complete `training_step` and `train`. The former should perform a single training step by optimizing against the reconstruction loss between the image and target (you might find `nn.MSELoss` suitable for this). The latter should be structured like training code you might have seen before, in other words:\n",
    "\n",

    "- For each epoch, you should:\n",
    "    - Iterate over the training data and perform a training step for each batch. We also recommend using & updating a progress bar, and logging to wandb if this is enabled in your training arguments.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Don't use wandb until you've ironed out the bugs in your code, and loss seems to be going down based on the in-notebook logging. This is why we've given you the `use_wandb` argument in your dataclass.\n",
    "- Remember to increment `self.step` as you train (this is necessary if you're passing this argument to `wandb.log`). Note we're using `step` here rather than `examples_seen` like in earlier exercises, because it'll prove more useful for our purposes.\n",
    "- Your wandb logging should take place in `training_step` not `train` (this is better practice in general because often there will be variables only defined in the scope of `training_step` that you might want to log - even though that's not the case here, it will be later).\n",
    "- Iterating through `self.trainloader` will give you tuples of `(img, label)`, but you don't need to use the labels - all you need is the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself disconnecting from runtime when you run the training code, then visit https://wandb.ai/authorize and get a `<LOGIN-KEY>` to use in this code: `wandb.login(key=<LOGIN-KEY>)`. If this fails (i.e. you're still getting disconnected), then we recommend either using VSCode instead or some other IDE, or just setting `wandb=False` and displaying / saving your logged output inline. You can take `imshow` and turn it into saved output via code like `imshow(..., return_fig=True).write_html(\"filename.html\")`."

    "This code generates images from a vector in the latent space which is zero in all directions, except for the first two dimensions. (Note, we normalize with `(0.3081, 0.1307)` in the code above because this is the mean and standard deviation of the MNIST dataset - see discussion [here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/normalization-in-the-mnist-example/457).)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is ... pretty underwhelming. Some of these shapes seem legible in some regions (e.g. in the demo example on Streamlit we have some patchy but still recognisable 9s, 3s, 0s and 4s in the corners of the latent space), but a lot of the space doesn't look like any recognisable number. For example, much of the middle region is just an unrecognisable blob. Using the default interpolation range of `(-1, 1)` makes things look even worse. And this is a problem, since our goal is to be able to randomly sample points inside this latent space and use them to generate output which resembles the MNIST dataset - this is our true goal, not accurate reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this happen? Well unfortunately, the model has no reason to treat the latent space in any meaningful way. It might be the case that almost all the images are embedded into a particular subspace of the latent space, and so the encoder only gets trained on inputs in this subspace. To further illustrate this, the code below feeds MNIST data into your encoder, and plots the resulting latent vectors (projected along the first two latent dimensions). Note that there are some very high-density spots, and other much lower-density spots. So it stands to reason that we shouldn't expect the decoder to be able to produce good output for all points in the latent space (especially when we're using a 5-dimensional latent space rather than just 2-dimensional as visualised below - we can imagine that 5D latent space would have significantly more \"dead space\").\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasise, we're not looking for a crisp separation of digits here. We're only plotting 2 of 5 dimensions, it would be a coincidence if they were cleanly separated. We're looking for efficient use of the space, because this is likely to lead to an effective generator when taken out of the context of the discriminator. We don't really see that here."

    "## Variational Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational autoencoders try and solve the problem posed by autoencoders: how to actually make the latent space meaningful, such that you can generate output by feeding a $N(0, 1)$ random vector into your model's decoder?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key perspective shift is this: **rather than mapping the input into a fixed vector, we map it into a distribution**. The way we learn a distribution is very similar to the way we learn our fixed inputs for the autoencoder, i.e. we have a bunch of linear or convolutional layers, our input is the original image, and our output is the tuple of parameters $(\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\Sigma(\\boldsymbol{x}))$ (as a trivial example, our VAE learning a distribution $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})=z(\\boldsymbol{x})$, $\\Sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})=0$ is equivalent to our autoencoder learning the function $z(\\boldsymbol{x})$ as its encoder).\n",
    "\n",
    "From this [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73) article:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Due to overfitting, the latent space of an autoencoder can be extremely irregular (close points in latent space can give very *different* decoded data, some point of the latent space can give *meaningless* content once decoded) and, so, we can’t really define a *generative* process that simply consists to sample a point from the *latent space* and make it go through the decoder to get new data. *Variational autoencoders* (VAEs) are autoencoders that tackle the problem of the latent space irregularity by making the encoder return a *distribution over the latent space* instead of a single point and by adding in the loss function a *regularisation* term over that returned distribution in order to ensure a better *organisation* of the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, in fewer words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A variational autoencoder can be defined as being an autoencoder whose training is regularised to avoid overfitting and ensure that the latent space has good properties that enable generative process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, this idea of mapping to a distribution sounds like a crazy hack - why on earth does it work? This diagram should help convey some of the intuitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/vae-scatter-one.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With our encoder, there was nothing incentivising us to make full and meaningful use of the latent space. It's hypothetically possible that our network was mapping all the inputs to some very small subspace and reconstructing them with perfect fidelity. This wouldn't have required numbers with different features to be far apart from each other in the latent space, because even if they are close together no information is lost. See the first image above.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with our variational autoencoder, each MNIST image produces a **sample** from the latent space, with a certain mean and variance. This means that, when two numbers look very different, their latent vectors are forced apart - if the means were close together then the decoder wouldn't be able to reconstruct them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another nice property of using random latent vectors is that the entire latent space will be meaningful. For instance, with autoencoders there is no reason why we should expect the linear interpolation between two points in the latent space to have meaningful decodings. The decoder output *will* change continuously as we continuously vary the latent vector, but that's about all we can say about it. However, if we use a variational autoencoder, we don't have this problem. The output of a linear interpolation between the cluster of $2$s and cluster of $7$s will be ***\"a symbol which pattern-matches to the family of MNIST digits, but has equal probability to be interpreted as a $2$ or a $7$\"***, and this is indeed what we find.\n",

    "### Reparameterisation trick\n",
    "\n",
    "One question that might have occurred to you - how can we perform backward passes through our network? We know how to differentiate with respect to the inputs to a function, but how can we differentiate wrt the parameters of a probability distribution from which we sample our vector? The solution is to convert our random sampling into a function, by introducing an extra parameter $\\epsilon$. We sample $\\epsilon$ from the standard normal distribution, and then express $\\boldsymbol{z}$ as a deterministic function of $\\mu$, $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = \\mu + \\sigma \\odot \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\odot$ is a notation meaning pointwise product, i.e. $z_i = \\mu_i + \\sigma_i \\epsilon_i$. Intuitively, we can think of this as follows: when there is randomness in the process that generates the output, there is also randomness in the derivative of the output wrt the input, so **we can get a value for the derivative by sampling from this random distribution**. If we average over enough samples, this will give us a valid gradient for training.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that if we have $\\sigma_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x})=0$ for all $\\boldsymbol{x}$, the VAE reduces to an autoencoder (since the latent vector $z = \\mu_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is once again a deterministic function of $\\boldsymbol{x}$). This is why it's important to add a KL-divergence term to the loss function, to make sure this doesn't happen. It's also why, if you print out the average value of $\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})$ while training, you'll probably see it stay below 1 (it's being pulled towards 1 by the KL-divergence loss, **and** pulled towards 0 by the reconstruction loss).\n",

However, instead of just writing $\\boldsymbol{z} \\sim N(\\mu_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\sigma_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x})^2I)$, we can write $\\boldsymbol{z}$ as a deterministic function of its inputs: $z = g(\\theta, x, \\epsilon)$, where $\\theta$ are the parameters of the distribution, $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is the input, and $\\epsilon$ is a randomly sampled value.

    "## Building a VAE\n",
    "\n",
    "For your final exercise of this section, you'll build a VAE and run it to produce the same kind of output you did in the previous section. Luckily, this won't require much tweaking from your encoder architecture. The decoder can stay unchanged; there are just two big changes you'll need to make:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabilistic encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than your encode outputting a latent vector $\\boldsymbol{z}$, it should output a mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$; both vectors of dimension `latent_dim_size`. We then sample our latent vector $\\boldsymbol{z}$ using $z_i = \\mu_i + \\sigma_i \\cdot \\epsilon_i$. Note that this is equivalent to $z = \\mu + \\Sigma \\epsilon$ as shown in the diagram above, but where we assume $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix (i.e. the auxiliary random variables $\\epsilon$ which we're sampling are independent). This is the most common approach taken in situations like these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - we actually calculate `mu` and `logsigma` rather than `mu` and `sigma` - we get `sigma = logsigma.exp()` from this. This is a more numerically stable method.\n",
    "\n",
    "How exactly should this work in your model's architecture? You can replace the final linear layer (which previously just gave you the latent vector) with two linear layers returning `mu` and `logsigma`, then you calculate `z` from these (and from a randomly sampled `epsilon`). If you want, you can combine the two linear layers into one linear layer with `out_channels=2*latent_dim_size`, then rearrange to split this up into `mu` and `logsigma` (this is what we do in the solution, and in the diagram below).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also return the parameters `mu` and `logsigma` in your VAE's forward function, as well as the final output - the reasons for this will become clear below.\n",

    "\n",
    "For consistency with code that will come later, we recommend having your `model.encoder` output be of shape `(2, batch_size, latent_dim_size)`, where `output[0]` are the mean vectors $\\mu$ and `output[1]` are the log standard deviation vectors $\\log \\sigma$. The tests below will check this. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've also given you a `sample_latent_vector` method - this should return the output of your encoder, but in the form of sampled latent vectors $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ rather than the deterministic output `model.encoder(x)` of shape `(2, batch_size, latent_dim_size)`. This will be a useful method for later (and you can use it in your implementation of `forward`)."

You can try training your VAE without this term, and it might do okay at reproducing $\\boldsymbol{x}$, but it will perform much worse when it comes time to use it for generation. Again, you can quantify this by encoding some input data and projecting it onto the first two dimensions. When you include this term you should expect to see a nice regular cloud surrounding the origin, but without this term you might see some irregular patterns or blind spots:\n",

In this particular case, $\\beta$ being too large means your model will too heavily prioritize having its latent vectors' distribution equal to the standard normal distribution, to the point where it might essentially lose all structure in the data and ignore accurate reconstruction. On the other hand, $\\beta$ being too small means we just reduce to the autoencoder case where the model has no incentive to make meaningful use of the latent space. Weights and biases hyperparameter searches are a good tool for sweeping over ranges and testing the results, but they'll only work if you log the relevant data / output and know how to interpret it."

The former is your own encoder's distribution of latent vectors which you may recall is $N(\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})^2)$, and the latter was assumed to be the uniform distribution $N(0, I)$. This just reduces to our KL penalty term from earlier.\n",

But we can pretend that the decoder output is actually the mean of a probability distribution, and we're choosing this mean as the value of our reconstruction $\\boldsymbol{x}'$. The reconstruction loss term in the formula above will be smallest when this mean is close to the original value $\\boldsymbol{x}$ (because then $p_\\theta(\\cdot \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$ will be a probability distribution centered around $\\boldsymbol{x}$). And it turns out that we can just replace this reconstruction loss with something that fulfils basically the same purpose (the $L_2$ penalty) - although we sometimes need to adjust these two terms (see $\\beta$-VAEs above).\n",

    "## How GANs work\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind GANs is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have two networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**.\n",
    "* The generator's job is to produce output realistic enough to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator's job is to try and tell the difference between real and fake output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is for both networks to be trained simultaneously, in a positive feedback loop: as the generator produces better output, the discriminator's job becomes harder, and it has to learn to spot more subtle features distinguishing real and fake images, meaning the generator has to work harder to produce images with those features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discriminator\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator works by taking an image (either real, or created by the generator), and outputting a single value between 0 and 1, which is the probability that the discriminator puts on the image being real. The discriminator sees the images, but not the labels (i.e. whether the images are real or fake), and it is trained to distinguish between real and fake images with maximum accuracy. The discriminator's loss function is the cross entropy between its probability estimates ($D(x)$ for real images, $D(G(z))$ for fake images) and the true labels ($1$ for real images, $0$ for fake images).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of generators in a GAN setup is generally a mirror image of the discriminator, with convolutions swapped out for **transposed convolutions**. This is the case for the DCGAN paper we'll be reading (which is why they only give a diagram of the generator, not both). The generator works by taking in a vector $z$, whose elements are all normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1. We call the space from which $z$ is sampled **latent dimension** or **latent space**, and we call $z$ a **latent vector**. The formal definition of a latent space is *an abstract multi-dimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events.* We'll dive a little deeper into what this means and the overall significance of latent spaces later on, but for now it's fine to understand this vector $z$ as a kind of random seed, which causes the generator to produce different outputs. After all, if the generator only ever produced the same image as output then the discriminator's job would be pretty easy (just subtract the image $g$ always produces from the input image, and see if the result is close to zero!). The generator's objective function is an increasing function of $D(G(z))$, in other words it tries to produce images $G(z)$ which have a high chance of fooling the discriminator (i.e. $D(G(z)) \\approx 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal outcome when training a GAN is for the generator to produce perfect output indistinguishable from real images, and the discriminator just guesses randomly. However, the precise nature of the situations when GANs converge is an ongoing area of study (in general, adversarial networks have very unstable training patterns). For example, you can imagine a situation where the discriminator becomes almost perfect at spotting fake outputs, because of some feature that the discriminator spots and that the generator fails to capture in its outputs. It will be very difficult for the generator to get a training signal, because it has to figure out what feature is missing from its outputs, and how it can add that feature to fool the discriminator. And to make matters worse, maybe marginal steps in that direction will only increase the probability of fooling the discriminator from almost-zero to slightly-more-than-almost-zero, which isn't much of a training signal! Later on we will see techniques people have developed to overcome problems like this and others, but in general they can't be solved completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Optional exercise - what conditions must hold for the discriminator's best strategy to be random guessing with probability 0.5?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary for the generator to be producing perfect outputs, because otherwise the discriminator could do better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the generator is producing perfect outputs, then the discriminator never has any ability to distinguish real from fake images, so it has no information. Its job is to minimise the cross entropy between its output distribution $(D(x), 1-D(x))$, and the distribution of real/fake images. Call this $(p, 1-p)$, i.e. $p$ stands for the proportion of images in training which are real. Note how we just used $p$ rather than $p(x)$, because there's no information in the image $x$ which indicates whether it is real or fake. Trying to minimize the cross entropy between $(p, 1-p)$ and $(D(x), 1-D(x))$ gives us the solution $D(x) = p$ for all $x$. In other words, our discriminator guesses real/fake randomly with probability equal to the true underlying frequency of real/fake images in the data. This is 0.5 if and only if the data contains an equal number of real and fake images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the necessary and sufficient conditions for $(\\forall x) \\; D(x) = 0.5$ being the optimal strategy are:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Each convolution should have kernel size 4, stride 2, padding 1. This will halve the width and height of the image at each step. The output channels of each convolution are given by the `hidden_channels` argument. For instance, if `img_channels=3` (because the image is RGB) and `hidden_channels=[128, 256, 512]`, then there will be three convolutions: the first mapping from 3 -> 128 channels, the second from 128 -> 256, and the third from 256 -> 512.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, we flatten the output of the final convolutional block, and use a fully connected layer to map it to a single value (i.e. a vector of length `batch_size`) which we then pass through a sigmoid to get a probability that the image is real. Again, we recommend the `Rearrange` module from the `einops` library for this.\n",

    "Gradient clipping is a useful technique for improving the stability of certain training loops, especially those like DCGANs which have potentially unstable loss functions. The idea is that you clip the gradients of your weights to some fixed threshold during backprop, and use these clipped gradients to update the weights. This can be done using [`nn.utils.clip_grad_norm`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html), which is called between the `loss.backward()` and `optimizer.step()` methods (since it directly modifies the `.grad` attributes of your weights). You shouldn't find this absolutely necessary to train your models, however it might help to clip the gradients to a value like `1.0` for your generator & discriminator. We've given you this as an optional parameter to use in your `DCGANArgs` dataclass."

    "    * You'll need to compute both losses from `training_step_generator` and `training_step_discriminator`. For the former you should pass in just the fake image (you're only training the generator to produce better fake images), for the latter you should pass in the real image and the **detached fake image** i.e. `img.detach()` (because you're training the discriminator to tell real from fake, and you don't want gradients propagating back to the generator).\n",

Although it varies depending on details of the hardware and dataset & model you're training with, at least for these exercises if your generator's output doesn't resemble anything like a face after the first epoch, then something's probably going wrong in your code."

    "**Question - what is the formula relating output size, input size, kernel size, stride and padding? (note, you shouldn't need to refer to this explicitly in your functions)**\n",

    "Without any padding, we had:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "output_size = input_size + kernel_size - 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Twice the `padding` parameter gets subtracted from the RHS (since we pad by the same amount on each side), so this gives us:\n",

    "output_size = input_size + kernel_size - 1 - 2 * padding\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, consider `stride`. As mentioned above, we can consider stride here to have the same effect as \"spacing out\" elements in the input. Each non-zero element will be `stride - 1` positions apart (for instance, `stride = 2` turns `[1, 2, 3]` into `[1, 0, 2, 0, 3]`). You can check that the number of zeros added between elements equals `(input_size - 1) * (stride - 1)`. When you add this to the right hand side, and simplify, you are left with:\n",

    "Padding should be pretty easy for you to implement on top of what you've already done. For strides, you will need to construct a strided version of the input which is \"spaced out\" in the way described above, before performing the transposed convolution. It might help to write a `fractional_stride` function; we've provided the code for you to do this."
