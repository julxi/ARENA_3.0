### ARENA

My study notes to https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0.git
(from February 2026)

I changed the structure to my taste.

#### My setup to run locally

1. `uv venv`
2. `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then I use VS code to run the notebooks in `notebooks`

#### On vast.ai

First install jupyter extension to vm.
Here it's just `uv pip instrall -r requirements.txt` (using the preactivated environment `main` managed in conda)
